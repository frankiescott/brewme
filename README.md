# BrewMe

This project was created in a 24 hour period from scratch for HackBU, a yearly hackathon competition sponsored by Binghamton Univeristy.

BrewMe utilizes the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) and the [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform) to query and display nearby breweries based on user location with a fun twist that we call, a "Hamiltonion Beer Cycle" - an optimized round-trip path to visit each brewery, displayed in a simple and sleek web interface.
